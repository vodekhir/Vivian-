💻 I'm also working at Codesmith as a software engineering lecturer.
👩🏽‍🔬 I’m looking to continue working on more open source projects and create cool tech in the science field.
🌻 I’m interested in any challenging frontend, backend, or fullstack opportunities available!
👋🏾 Let's talk about Typescript, React, Next.js, Redux, Testing/TDD, Node, Express, SQL, NoSQL(mongo), Data Structures, REST APIs and much more!
🎓 I love learning. I'm currently looking into Python, AWS, C++, Unreal Engine and Unity (Can you tell I like 🎮 ?)
